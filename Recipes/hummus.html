        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="text">Often I have found myself wanting with the local hummus' that my community has to offer.
            It tasted so bland, so boring. I thought that's what hummus was, and all it could be.
            In, short I was an idiot. At the time I could never fully express why, but with
             what I know now it is clear as day. Tahini. This magically concoction of sesame
              seeds give hummus the rich flavor it is famous for. The only downside is it
               is the most expensive ingredient in hummus. This is why the hummus around
                me leaves much to be desired, they are skimping on the tahini. 
                This is the cardinal sin of hummus, and one I am hopefull to fully avoid.
        </p>

        <p class="text">Note: A word of warning. All measurements are estimates. I tend to cook with my 
            eyes and my heart, and as such, the measurements may not be exact. The big thing 
            to keep in mind is to keep your solids and liquids in equalibrium to get that 
            perfect smooth hummus.
