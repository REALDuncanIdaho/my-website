        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p class="text">Carbs and fat. Two things I have been trying to stay away from in recent times. 
            Too much is bad for your heart, your weight, and just about everthing else 
            that keeps our sacks of flesh going. Yet, when brought together these two things 
            create something almost holy. This metamorphosis happens specificly in the city 
            of New York. It's as simple as this. Get your crust as thin as you can, don't 
            skimp on the cheese, and char your pie just enough to activate the fats and get 
            a slight crunch, but not too much! Pizza is an art form and even with the best 
            recipe, you will still face failure upon failure. Come, and fail with me.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>Just the hottest oven you can get your hands on. Optimal would be a 
                dedicated pizza oven that can get to 900F but do with what you can. I 
                use a normal oven that maxes out at 500F.</li>
            <li>Pizza steel/stone, recommend steel for better thermal transfer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>00 grade flour, 700g</li>
            <li>Yeast, (Red Star Active Dry!)</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce(recommend mids!), 2-3 jars</li>
            <li>Any cheese blend you want(I prefer mozarella), 2-3 bags</li>
            <li>Any toppings you like</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Water, 440g</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>Measure out half your water, 220g, in a bowl. Use warm water, add pinch of
                yeast. If the water is too hot you'll kill the yeast. Let sit for 3-5 
            minutes.</li>
            <li>Measure out half your flour, 350g, and add to large bread container. Add 
                in water/yeast, and mix into a solid mass. Do not over-kneed. Once together 
                cover container and let sit at room temp overnight.</li>
            <li>Add rest of flour and water to mixture. Kneed into a solid mass again. 
                Cover and let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from container and kneed into a ball. Should remove all 
                bumps, 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare a large bowl, preferablly aluminum, by brushing inside with olive 
                oil. Set dough in bowl, lightly brush with olive oil. Cover and let sit, 
                around 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from container, and segment into 4 pieces. Roll and form 
                each segment into a ball, place in individual container and seal. Let sit 
                for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook preheat oven to max temp. (helpful to add a cast iron 
                pan above/below steel/stone in oven)</li>
            <li>Roll out dough into a circle. Recommend to use gravity and your hands to 
                shape dough, be gentle. brush crust in olive oil, season with 
                thyme/rosemary.</li>
            <li>If using a regular oven that goes to 500F, put dough in oven to cook as is 
                for a few minutes. This will help make sure your pizza is fully cooked, 
                since the cheese and toppings will cook faster than the crust. Then remove 
                from oven.</li>
            <li>Add sauce, cheese, and toppings as see fit. Then place pizza in oven. 
                Rotate pizza if needed, remove once cheese just starts to blacken. Let sit 
                to cool before cutting and service.</li>
            <li>Wow, that was a lot. You have a lot of dishes to do. I hope you've been 
                doing those all this time! Enjoy!</li>
